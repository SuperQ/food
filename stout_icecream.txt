This was a total success, if I do say so myself. The ice cream base has a slight bitter flavor but also a bit of a toffee flavor from the stout. The sweetness of the Heath bar is a good foil to that bitterness while the toffee in it helps bring out more of that toffee flavor. The texture of the ice cream is beautifully creamy making a good base for the crunch of the Heath Bar. This is a flavor I'll definitely make again!

Oatmeal Stout and Heath Bar Ice Cream

16 oz oatmeal stout
3 egg yokes
1/2 c sugar
1 c cream
1 c half & half
2 Heath bars, chopped

In a saucepan bring the stout to a boil. Allow to reduce to about 1 cup.

In a large bowl whisk the egg yokes & sugar together until light yellow & thick. Set aside.

Reduce the heat under the stout to low & add the cream & milk. Bring to a simmer. Slowly stir into the egg mixture. Its important to add the milk slowly & stir so you don't end up with scrambled eggs. Return to the saucepan & cook while stirring until the mixture is slightly thickened. Strain into a clean storage container. Refrigerate until completely cold.

Process according to your ice cream maker's directions. Add the chopped Heath bar pieces during the last 5 minutes of mixing. Let freeze for a few hours before serving.

Makes about 1 quart.
