Recipe for Gruyere Popovers, in honor of the 44th President of the United States

A popover pan is obviously ideal here, and I've based the timing and quantities on the presumption that you'll be using one. If using a muffin pan, you may get a slightly different yield and will have to keep an eye on the cook time.

Makes 6 if using a traditional popover pan

1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
2 eggs
1 cup milk (I used 2%)
1 tablespoon butter, melted nd cooled slightly, plus additional for brushing the popover pan
1/2 cup shredded gruyere cheese (about 1-1/2 ounces)

Place the ungreased popover pan in a cold oven. Turn the oven to 450 and preheat until it reaches the proper temperature.

Meanwhile, whisk the flour, salt, and nutmeg together in a medium mixing bowl or 2-quart glass measuring cup with a lip.

In a separate medium bowl, whisk the eggs lightly to combine. Whisk in the milk and 1 tablespoon of the melted butter. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and whisk until just combined. Fold in the gruyere.

When the oven is hot, carefully remove the empty popover pan and brush the cups and tops with the extra melted butter. Pour in the batter, filling each cup only halfway.

Slide into the hot oven and bake, undisturbed, for 20 minutes. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DURING THIS TIME. Lower the heat to 350 and bake 15 minutes longer, or until puffed high and deep golden brown. Serve immediately.
