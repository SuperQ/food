https://www.livewellbakeoften.com/easy-buttermilk-biscuits/

## Ingredients
* 2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour, spooned & leveled
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 6 tablespoons (85 grams) cold unsalted butter, cubed
* 3/4 cup (180 ml) cold buttermilk, plus more for the tops of the biscuits


## Instructions
* Preheat oven to 230Â°.
* Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat and set aside.
* In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt until well combined.
* Add the in the cubed cold butter and cut into the dry ingredients using a pastry cutter (you may also use a food processor for this step) until you have small pea sized pieces of butter.
* Pour the cold buttermilk into the mixture and gently work it together until the dough starts to come together.
* Scoop the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently work it together with your hands.
* Pat the dough into a rectangle and fold it in thirds. Turn the dough, gather any crumbs, and flatten back into a rectangle.
* Repeat this process two more times.
* Place the dough onto a lightly floured surface and pat it down into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle (make sure to measure!).
* Using a floured 2.5-inch biscuit cutter, cut out the biscuits.
* Continue to gather any scrap pieces of dough, patting it back down to 1/2-inch thickness, and cutting it until you have 12 biscuits.
* I suggest trying to get as many as you can the first time, as you continue to work the dough the biscuits won't be quite as good.
* Arrange the biscuits on the baking sheet touching each other.
* Brush the top of each biscuit with a little bit of buttermilk.
* Bake at for about 15-17 minutes or until lightly golden brown.
* Remove from the oven and brush with melted butter if desired.
* Allow to cool for a few minutes, serve, and enjoy!
