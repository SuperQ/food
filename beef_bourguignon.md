## Ingredients
* 1 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 6 ounces (170g) bacon, roughly chopped
* 3 pounds (1 1/2 kg) beef brisket, trimmed of fat (chuck steak or stewing beef) cut into 2-inch chunks
* 1 large carrot sliced 1/2-inch thick
* 1 large white onion, diced
* 40g (6 cloves) garlic, minced (divided)
* 1 pinch coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
* 2 tablespoons flour
* 12 small pearl onions (optional)
* 3 cups red wine like Merlot, Pinot Noir, or a Chianti -- for a milder sauce, use only 2 cups of wine
* 2-3 cups beef stock (if using 2 cups of wine, use 3 cups beef stock)
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 beef bullion cube, crushed
* 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, finely chopped
* 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped (divided)
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 pound fresh small white or brown mushrooms, quartered
* 2 tablespoons butter

## TRADITIONAL OVEN METHOD:

* Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
* Heat the oil in a large dutch oven or heavy based pot.
* Sauté the bacon over medium heat for about 3 minutes, until crisp and browned.
* Transfer with a slotted spoon to a large dish and set aside.
* Pat dry beef with paper towel
* Sear in batches in the hot oil/bacon fat until browned on all sides.
* Remove to the dish with the bacon.
* In the remaining oil/bacon fat, sauté the carrots and diced onions until softened, (about 3 minutes)
* Aadd 2/3 cloves minced garlic and cook for 1 minute.
* Drain excess fat (leave about 1 tablespoon in the pan) and return the bacon and beef back into the pot
* season with 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt and 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper.
* Sprinkle with flour, toss well and cook for 4-5 minutes to brown.
* Add the pearl onions, wine and enough stock so that the meat is barely covered.
* Then add the tomato paste, bullion and herbs.
* Bring to a simmer on the stove.
* Cover, transfer to lower part of the oven and simmer for 3 to 4 hours, or until the meat is fall apart tender (adjust the heat so that the liquid simmers very slowly).

* In the last 5 minutes of cooking time, prepare your mushrooms:
* Heat the butter in a medium-sized skillet/pan over heat.
* When the foam subsides, add the remaining 2 cloves garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds),
* Then add in the mushrooms.
* Cook for about 5 minutes, while shaking the pan occasionally to coat with the butter.
* Season with salt and pepper, if desired. Once they are browned, set aside.

* Place a colander over a large pot (I do this in my clean kitchen sink).
* Remove the casserole from the oven and carefully empty its contents into the colander (you want to collect the sauce only).
* Discard the herbs
* Return the beef mixture back into the dutch oven or pot.
* Add the mushrooms over the meat.
* Remove any fat off the sauce and simmer for a minute or two, skimming off any additional fat which rises to the surface.
* You should be left with about 2 1/2 cups of sauce thick enough to coat the back of a spoon lightly. 
* If the sauce is too thick, add a few tablespoons of stock.
* If the sauce is too thin, boil it over medium heat for about 10 minutes, or until reduced to the right consistency.
* Taste for seasoning and adjust salt and pepper, if desired.
* Pour the sauce over the meat and vegetables.
* If you are serving immediately, simmer the beef bourguignon for 2 to 3 minutes to heat through.
* Garnish with parsley and serve with mashed potatoes, rice or noodles.
* To serve the following day, allow the casserole to cool completely, cover and refrigerate.
* The day of serving, remove from refrigerator for at least an hour before reheating.
* Place over medium-low heat and let simmer gently for about 10 minutes, basting the meat and vegetables with the sauce.
