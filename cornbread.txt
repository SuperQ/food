* 1 cup yellow corn meal
* 1 cup All Purpose Flour
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1 Tbsp. Baking Powder
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1 cup milk
* 1/3 cup vegetable oil
* 1 large egg, beaten and at room temperature

Pre heat your oven to 400 degrees F.

In a mixing bowl, combine the corn meal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Break up any clumps with a fork if need be.

Combine the milk, oil, and beaten egg in a separate bowl. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix well, creating a thick batter.

Pour the batter into an 8" x 8" glass baking dish or an 8" cake pan. Spread evenly. Place in oven and bake for 23 to 25 minutes. (You can do the toothpick trick to determine if the bread is done, but the golden color of the crust was all I needed.)

Serves 8-10
