# New York pizza

Source: http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2012/07/the-pizza-lab-three-doughs-to-know.html

For ~4 pizzas:
* All-purpose or bread flour: 100% (500g); bread flour is best, but all-purpose will do just fine.
* Sugar: 2% (10g)
* Salt: 1.5% (7.5g)
* Instant yeast: 1.5% (7.5g); fresh yeast (25g)
* Olive oil: 5% (25g)
* Water: 67% (333g)

## Mixing and rising the dough

Use a stand mixer or a food processor. I prefer the latter, because it develops gluten a bit faster and with New York dough, you can bake it the day after itâ€™s made, so there is no need for a long, slow fermentation that best benefits no-knead doughs or stand-mixer doughs.

1. Combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in bowl of food processor; pulse 3 to 4 times until incorporated.
2. Add olive oil and water.
3. Run the food processor until the mixture forms a ball that rides around the bowl above the blade, which takes approximately 15 seconds.
4. Continue processing 15 seconds longer.
5. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it once or twice by hand or until a smooth ball is formed.
6. Check if the dough passes the [_windowpane test_](https://www.seriouseats.com/technique-the-windowpane-test-for-pizza-dough).
7. Divide the dough into three even parts and place each piece in a covered quart-sized deli container or in a zipper-lock freezer bag.
8. Refrigerate the pieces of dough to allow them to rise for at least 1 day and up to 5 days.
9. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, shape it into balls, and allow it to rest at room temperature for at least 2 hours before baking.
