Sized for ~75-100ppl:

    6 Large Onions
    24 cloves of garlic
    1 1/3 cup olive oil
    20 pounds of hamburger
    mashed potatoes ( see below)
    2 pounds frozen peas and carrots, thawed
    2 pounds frozen green bean, thawed
    4 pounds frozen peas, thawed
    3 pounds frozen corn, thawed
    5 pounds grated cheddar


Get the potatoes cooking first, then get the shepherd's pie ready. Brown the hamburger and garlic and onions together in the olive oil in about 4 batches, spread into each of 4 pans. Set aside some of the onions and garlic for the vegetarian batch, they are browned with olive oil and added to the fifth pan. Combine the vegetables with the meat - the vegetarians get proportionately more. Season with Worcestershire sauce and black pepper. Spread the mashed potatoes evenly over the meat, sprinkle with grated cheese and bake for 2 hours at 300 degrees. For those who cannot eat dairy, have some without cheese. Cover the vegetarian pan with foil before baking so it won't get too dry.


For potatoes:

    30 pounds russet potatoes
    1 pound butter
    Reserved potato cooking water for thinning
    Salt
    Black pepper

Peel, and slice the potatoes. Boil in salted water until very tender, about 30 minutes from the time the water reaches boiling. Drain in colander reserving about 3 quarts of potato water for thinning. Mash potatoes and butter, add salt and pepper to taste and thin with liquid to good spreading consistency.
