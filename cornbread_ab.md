## [Better-Than-Granny's Creamed Corn](http://altonbrown.com/creamed-corn-recipe/)
Serves 6
Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
* 100g (1/2 medium) onion, diced fine
* 2 pinches kosher salt
* 1 sprig rosemary, bruised (this is, crushed roughly between your hands)[0]
* 1 kg corn
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric (to up the yellow a bit)
* 1 tablespoons stone-ground cornmeal
* 250ml
* 1 pinch black pepper, freshly ground

Instructions
* Put the butter in a 3-quart saucier and melt over medium heat.
* Add the onion, salt and rosemary and sweat until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.

* Add the corn, sugar and turmeric to the saucier and continue cooking over medium-high heat until the liquid from the corn thickens a bit, about 2 minutes.
* Sprinkle the cornmeal onto the corn mixture and stir to combine.
* Add the cream, reduce the heat to medium and cook until the corn is very soft, 2 to 3 minutes.

* Fish out the rosemary, season with pepper and serve as a side to just about anything, or use to make cornbread (check the other posts).

Notes
[0]: Rosemary is my favorite herb to pair with corn. The resinous, evergreen flavor (not to mention aroma) balances the sweet, grassiness of the corn.
