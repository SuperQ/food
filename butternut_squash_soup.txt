Ingredients

    * 6 cups (about 2 large squash) seeded 2-inch wide chunks butternut squash
    * Melted butter, for brushing
    * 1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus 1 teaspoon
    * 1 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper, plus 1/2 teaspoon
    * 3 cups chicken or vegetable stock
    * 4 tablespoons honey
    * 1 teaspoon minced ginger
    * 4 ounces heavy cream
    * 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg

Directions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Brush the flesh of the squash with a little butter and season with 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper. On a sheet pan lay the squash flesh side up. Roast for about 30 to 35 minutes or until the flesh is nice and soft.

Scoop the flesh from the skin into a pot and add the stock, honey, and ginger. Bring to a simmer and puree using a stick blender. Stir in the heavy cream and return to a low simmer. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
