For the Masa:
2 cups instant corn masa flour (228g)
1½-2 cups warm water or broth
½ teaspoon salt
⅓ cup coconut oil (softened), lard, shortening, or vegetable oil
1 teaspoon chili powder
For the Tamales:
20-24 dried cornhusks, rehydrated in boiling water for 20 minutes

2 cups of your filling of choice (see options below)


Make the masa: In a mixing bowl, beat the fat component on high speed to whip it up (skip this if using liquid vegetable oil).
Add the masa flour and about a cup of the water. Add another ½ - 1 cup water to make a soft, moist dough. Add the salt and chili powder.
Assemble: Pull out a cornhusk and lay it down, smoothest side up, and the pointier end towards you.
Put about 2 tablespoons masa dough on the husk and pat it out very thin. Put about 2 tablespooons filling in a line down the middle of the masa. Roll it up, using the husk to form it into a little log. Fold over one side of the husk, then fold the bottom up and roll over the rest of the husk. Tie it closed with a thin strip of another husk if you like. It does look cute that way.
Roll up a bunch more tamales that way. You'll get about 16 tamales from this recipe.
To cook: Set up a steamer basket in a large pot.
Lay some husks over the bottom of the steamer, sit the tamales upright in the pot, cover with another layer of husks. Put a tight lid on it.
Steam for about and hour and a half, adding water if necessary.
