* 1 packet (7g) active dry yeast
* 1 tsp sugar
* 250g all-purpose flour
* 50g medium grind cornmeal
* 7g kosher salts
* ⅛ tsp cream of tartar 
* 50ml vegetable oil

### For the sauce

* 400g can of whole tomatoes
* 1 white onion
* Few cloves of garlic
* Pinch of crushed red pepper flake
* Shake of oregano
* Shake of basil
* 2-3 Tbsp tomato paste
* 1 Tbsp sugar
* Olive oil

### For the pizza toppings

* Mild Italian sausage, uncooked (optional)
* Deli-style sliced Provolone cheese
* Deli-style low moisture mozzarella cheese
* Pre-grated parmesan 

## Instructions

### Tomato Sauce

* Crush whole tomatoesn in a bowl until the tomatoes are bite-sized pieces. 
* Finely chop half a white onion
* Mince garlic.
* Into a high walled sauté plan, put a few tablespoons of olive oil and heat over medium until shimmering. 
* Add chopped onion and sweat for 2-3 minutes or until translucent around the edges
* Add crushed garlic and sauté for an additional minute until fragrant.
* Add a herbs/spices and tomato paste.
* Cook together for one minute.
* Add the crushed tomatoes along with a tablespoon of sugar.
* Simmer for 20-30 minutes over medium heat, stirring regularly to prevent scorching, until the raw tomato flavor has cooked off and the sauce is thick.
* You know it’s thick enough when you drag a spoon through the sauce, it will part.

### Crust


* Into a stand mixer bowl, add yeast, sugar, water.
* Let bloom for 10 minutes until foamy.
* In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, cornmeal, salt, and cream of tartar.
* Pour dry ingredients into yeast mixture.
* Add vegetable oil. 
* Using a dough hook, stir the mixture on low speed for 1-2 minutes until dough is off the side of the bowl.
* Then, put speed to medium for 7-8 minutes to knead until smooth and elastic.
* If the dough is too hydrated, lightly flour a cooking surface and knead by hand for an additional 1-2 minutes until consistency is soft and tacky, but not sticky. 
* Stretch dough into a ball and put it into a lightly oiled bowl, tossing to make sure it’s fully covered in oil.
* Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and sit out at room temperature for 60-90 minutes, or until it has doubled in size. 

### Assembly

* Lubricate a 12-inch cast iron skillet with vegetable oil.
* Grease your hands and coax the dough out of the bowl and into the pan.
* Push into the shape of a pizza by stretching and pushing the dough up to the sides of the pan.
* Let rest under cover of plastic wrap for 20-30 minutes.
* Press dough to sides of the pan, and it should easily hold its shape.
* Optional: Lay down a layer of raw mild Italian sausage into a nice even layer before the cheese. 
* Place a layer of deli-style sliced Provolone cheese on top next, then follow with a thick layer of low moisture mozzarella. More cheese = more cheese stretch! 
* Generously top cheese with tomato sauce until cheese is hidden.
* Then, sprinkle pre-grated parmesan on the sauce and drizzle olive oil on both the sauce and around the edge of the crust. 
* Put into 220°C oven for 25-35 minutes, rotating once during baking until cooked through.
* Run a thin spatula around the outside edge to make sure that there’s no sticking.
* Slide pizza out the pan and wait at least 10 minutes before cutting and serving pizza.
* Enjoy!
