* 2 tsp cumin or jeera
* 2 green cardamoms or elaichi (optional)
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 2 cloves or laung (optional)
* 1 small  black cardamom or badi elaichi (optional)

* 1/2 tsp turmeric powder or haldi
* 1 tsp cayenne powder or lal mirch powder
* 1 tsp garam masala
* 1 tsp coriander powder or daniya powder (optional)
* 1/2 tsp kasuri methi or dry fenugreek leaves (optional)
* 1/8 tsp hing or asafoetida (optional)

* 1 tbsps butter or 1 tbsp cream for Garnish

## Procedure

* Wash urad dal and rajma together several times and soak overnight or at least for 4 to 5 hours.
* Rinse both the lentils a few times. 
* Then drain and add them to the cooker or pot.
* Add bay leaf.
* Add water
* Cook until soft.
* Both urad dal and rajma must cook to very soft. When mashed with a spoon the dal and rajma must be soft and get mashed well easily.  If not then pour another half cup water and continue to cook for another 3 whistles on a medium heat. 


* Heat a heavy bottom pot / pan or handi with butter or oil. 
* Add all whole spices – cumin, cardamoms, cloves & cinnamon. All spices are optional except cumin. Allow to crackle. 
* Then add hing, ginger garlic and green chilli. Saute until aromatic.
* Next throw in the onions and fry until they turn golden. 
* Then transfer tomato puree, turmeric, chilli powder, garam masala, coriander powder (optional) and salt. 
* Saute well until the masala leaves the pan.
* Pour the cooked dal or lentils along with the stock.

* Stir and cook on a a low flame until the dal thickens. I cook for about
  60 mins stirring often in between to prevent burning the bottom.  Slow
  cooked dal tastes best.
* You will need to add half cup water when ever the dal thickens. It may
  need about 1 to 1Â½ cup water more as and when needed. 
* You will be left with a thick creamy dal makhani. Sprinkle kasuri methi
  if using. Pour cream and stir. Turn off the stove & keep it covered.
* Garnish dal makhani with butter or cream, coriander leaves & ginger
  juliennes. Serve dal makhani with naan, basmati rice, roti or jeera rice.
