2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour
2 (10g) teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
3/4 teaspoons ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 large egg
1/2 cup (110g) (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
75g sugar
150g molasses

Coarse sanding or raw sugar (for rolling)

Place racks in lower and upper thirds of oven; preheat to 180Â°C.  (Or 190 if non-convection)

Whisk flour, baking soda in large bowl, set aside.

Add cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and salt in a small bowl.
Whisk egg, butter, sugar, molasses, and brown sugar in bowl.

Mix in dry ingredients just to combine.

Chill dough, 20+min

Place sanding sugar in a shallow bowl.

Scoop out dough by the tablespoonful and roll into balls, dust with sugar.

Place on parchment-lined baking sheets, 5cm spacing

Bake cookies 8-10min, rotating baking sheets halfway through.

They should be puffed, cracked, and just set around edges (over-baked cookies won't be chewy)

Transfer to wire cooling racks.

Storage:  Cookie dough balls can be frozen and stored for 2 weeks.

Let sit at room temperature 30 minutes before rolling in sugar and baking.
