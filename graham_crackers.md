# Graham Crackers

From https://cookiesandcups.com/homemade-graham-crackers-recipe/

## Ingredients

* 115g butter, room temperature
* 200g light brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 135g all purpose flour
* 270g whole wheat flour
* 120ml cup milk
* 40g granulated sugar

## Directions

Oven to  350°F - 175°C

* Mix: In the bowl of your stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the butter and brown sugar together for 2 minutes, until it is completely combined. 
* Add: Add in the vanilla, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and mix for 30 seconds until evenly incorporated.
* Combine: Turn the mixer to low and add in the flours and milk in alternating portions, beginning and ending with the flour. Mix until everything is combined, the dough will be thick.
* Refrigerate: Form the dough into a ball and flatten it into a disk. Wrap the disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 4 hours or overnight.
* Prep: When you’re ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside.
* Roll: On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8-inch thickness. Using a knife, or pizza cutter, cut the dough into 3.5×2.5- inch rectangles.
* Sprinkle: Sprinkle the granulated sugar evenly onto the pieces, pressing lightly into the dough. Prick the dough with a fork to create the store-bought look.
* Bake: Place the dough rectangles onto the prepared baking sheet 1/2- inch apart. Bake them for 9-11 minutes until the edges are lightly golden.
* Cool: Transfer your graham crackers to a wire rack to cool completely.
